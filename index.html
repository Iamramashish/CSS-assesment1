   <h2 class="class">What is CSS?</h2> 
   <ol class="list" type="1">
   <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
   <br>
   <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li> 
   <br>
   <li><strike> Css is not neccesary</strike><strong style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work.</strong>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
   <br>
   <li style="text-decoration: underline;"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
   <br>
   </ol>
 <h2 class="class">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
<ul class="list1">
    <li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
    <br>
    <li> Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <br>
    <li> External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <br>
    <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <strong style="background-color: yellow;"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</strong> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
    <p class="para"> When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
<br><br>
In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
<br><br>
There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
